              San Pantaleo, picturesque village, with artisanal shops and
              restaurants, Is very closed to the glamorous area of Porto Rotondo

            </li>
            <li>
              Posada, beautiful medieval village, with the tower/castle to visit
              and lots of narrow streets to get lost into. Restaurants and sea

              nice beach walk.

                  In Lanusei Village (free parking at Parcheggio di Piazza
                  Mameli multistore parking, below the surface floor) take a
                  walk in via Roma, if you are stopping there for a meal in the
                  village I recommend. Ristorante Pizzeria Ka.Mi.Ste.

                  amazing gelato stop at Bar gelateria del Corso or for a drink
